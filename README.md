# Syeda Tasnim Fabiha – Academic Website Template

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic homepage.  
It is a **single-page, minimal, USC-themed** site built with plain HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript for smooth scrolling.

You are welcome to **fork and adapt this template for your own academic website**, If you use it, please include a small attribution:
